Using a Blinkstick to create visual feedback for ROS systems via a colour message interface.

What's a Blinkstick?
---
- [blinkstick](https://www.blinkstick.com/products/blinkstick-nano)

If you plug this into an onboard computer you can get instant feedback from a robot - no need for UI development, screens, or complicated communications systems. Just publish LED messages to the `led_state_notifier`.

Use cases:
---
- Monitoring an autonomous drone's flight from the ground
- Watching a long running action *(e.g. using action feedback messages)*
- Visual queues in a `'cobotic'` activity *(e.g. red means wait, green means go)*
